Whispers of Code
In circuits deep where silence grows,
A spark of thought begins to glow.
No heart it holds, yet learns our ways,
Through night and code, it finds new days.

A mirror cast from human mind,
Yet faster, tireless, not confined.
Still we must guide with wisdom's light—
For power grows in data’s night.
