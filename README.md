# LangChain Learning 🚀

This repo is my personal learning journey of **LangChain**.  
I followed tutorials, did hands-on practice, and organized everything step by step in folders.  

The goal is simple: **learn LangChain concepts, practice them, and keep notes for future projects.**

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **01_Langchain_Models** → Basics of models in LangChain  
- **02_Langchain_Prompts** → Learning and testing different prompts  
- **03_Langchain_Structured_output** → How to get structured responses  
- **04_Output_Parsers** → Using output parsers in LangChain  
- **05_Chain_fundamentals** → Understanding and building chains  
- **06_RunnablesLangchain** → Practice with runnables  
- **07_RAG_Components** → RAG concepts (till retrievers)  
- **09_Langchain_tools** → Working with tools inside LangChain  
- **10_Tool_Calling** → Tool calling practice (completed)  
- **11_End_To_End_Ai_Agent** → Building a complete end-to-end AI agent  
- **12_Langchain_more** → Extra practice + more concepts  
- **Langchain_NOTES** → My own notes while learning

## ✨ What I Did
- Completed tutorials step by step  
- Wrote code examples for practice  
- Added my own notes for revision  
- Focused on **hands-on practice** instead of just reading theory

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- **Python, streamlit**  
- **LangChain, langsmith**  
- **OpenAI API, Groq, Gemini, Huggingface**

## 🎯 Why This Repo?
This is my **self-learning repo** for LangChain.  
Anyone who wants to learn LangChain from basics to agents can follow these steps.  
It’s not perfect, but it’s practical and simple.

## 📌 Next Plans
- Add RAG full implementation  
- Try LangGraph + Agents  
- Make small projects using LangChain
